=== Limitations of Configuration Cache

[%step]
* What about the work of the build engineer?
* What about dependency upgrades and other build focused engineering tasks?

* Invalidation
* No Remote  Cache

=== Did you say cache miss?
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* On a miss, the configuration phase needs to run
* But, with no shared mutable state between projects, it could
[%step]
** Run in parallel
*** following the projects hierarchy
** Be cached incrementally
*** task sub-graphs cached per project


=== Isolated Projects constraints
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

1. No _mutable_ cross-project access during configuration


=== Constraints violations
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

[.medium]
> Access to mutable state of another project is forbidden

[.medium.top-margin]
Examples:

[%step.medium]
* `allprojects { group = "..." }`
* `version = rootProject.version`
* `dependsOn(project(":b").tasks.findByName("foo"))`

=== Directions of development
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

* Performance benefits
[%step]
* Compatible APIs and patterns
* Ecosystem adoption

[.notes]
--
* The team's approach is to make incremental progress on all fronts and get feedback
* Currently, we work with select early adopters
** There are also enthusiasts
* Later we'll announce the feature wider and ask for community to try it out

=== Isolated Projects Adoption

* Ecosystem plugins
** Java ‚òëÔ∏è
** Kotlin üèóÔ∏è
** Android üèóÔ∏è
* Other plugins
** Core validation plugins ‚òëÔ∏è
** Other core plugins ‚è≥
** Popular community plugins ‚è≥


=== Performance benefits

* Parallel CC store ‚òëÔ∏è
* Parallel configuration for Sync ‚òëÔ∏è
* Parallel configuration for CLI ‚òëÔ∏è
* Incremental configuration for Sync üèóÔ∏è

=== Isolated Projects-friendly patterns
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

* Convention plugins
* Task-output sharing via dependency management

[.notes]
--
* Problem: root project (or applied plugin) configuring other projects
* Dependency management is mostly IP-compatible by design
--


=== Isolated Projects-safe APIs
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

[.medium]
* Safe project view -- `IsolatedProject`
** `rootProject.isolated.projectDirectory`
* New lifecycle callbacks -- `GradleLifecycle`
** `gradle.lifecycle.beforeProject { group = "..." }`
* Project-free dependencies with capabilities -- `requireFeature()`
** `implementation(project(":other"))` +
   `{ capabilities { requireFeature("foo") } }`

[.notes]
--
* More APIs are coming in the next releases to simplify common use-cases
--


[background-color="#02303a"]
=== Demo
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

[.notes]
****
* Use `ip-parallel` demo
* Note on latest versions (Gradle 8.11-milestone, IDEA EAP)
* Parallel configuration for CLI
* Parallel configuration for Sync
* Introduce a violation with allprojects-sets-group
* Show the violation in the report
* Fix the violation
****

=== Isolated Projects Status
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

* Alpha experiment on top of the Configuration Cache
* Focuses on speeding up the IDE experience first
* Interesting for early adopters

[.notes]
--
* We're really close to have IntelliJ and Gradle ready for early adopters
--

=== Early adoption approach

* Read Isolated Projects overview in the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/isolated_projects.html[userguide]
* Start with the `help` task with +
  [.medium]`-Dorg.gradle.unsafe.isolated-projects=true`
** Inspect the violations in the report
* For Sync, add the line to the `gradle.properties` +
  [.medium]`org.gradle.unsafe.isolated-projects=true`
* Report found problems to community plugins you use

[.notes]
--
* Be CC compatible
* Remember to use the latest Gradle and the latest IDEA
* Should work for Java-only projects
* Can still be interesting to gauge the scope for, say, Kotlin projects

// [%step]
// * Isolated Projects detects violations

// * Creating buckets of coupled projects
// * Configuring and caching them in parallel and incrementally
