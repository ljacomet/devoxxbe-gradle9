[%step]
* What about the work of the build engineer?
* What about dependency upgrades and other build focused engineering tasks?

=== Did you say cache miss?

[%step]
* On a miss, the configuration phase needs to run
* But, with no shared mutable state between projects, it could
[%step]
** Run in parallel
*** following the projects hierarchy
** Be cached incrementally
*** task sub-graphs cached per project

=== More constraints

* No _mutable_ cross project access during configuration
** Example: No `allprojects` or `subprojects` that _mutates_ project configuration

=== Progressive adoption

[%step]
* Isolated Projects detects violations
* aka. configuration-coupling between projects
* Creating buckets of coupled projects
* Configuring and caching them in parallel and incrementally

=== Isolated Projects Status

* Alpha experiment on top of the Configuration Cache
* Interesting for early adopters
* Focuses on speeding up the IDE experience first

[.notes]
****
* We're really close to have IntelliJ and Gradle ready for early adopters
