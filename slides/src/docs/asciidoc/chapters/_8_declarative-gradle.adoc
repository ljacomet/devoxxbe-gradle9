=== Challenges 🔥

Gradle's build language characteristics:
[%step, none]
* Flexible, extensible, & adaptable to complex requirements 👍
* Appreciated by advanced users 👍
* Significant learning curve 👎
* Projects often look very different from one another 👎

[.notes]
****
* While it has long been a best practice that build scripts should be declarative, and the build logic should be kept in plugins, this is not the reality for many projects.
* We’ve seen projects in the wild that mix declarative and imperative code and make build scripts that are long and complex.
* Gradle-specific concepts used in build scripts are not always familiar to software developers.
* This can make Gradle less approachable for developers unfamiliar with Gradle.
* At the same time, it makes it difficult for the IDEs to offer reliable support for editing build scripts.

Current Gradle is

* Extensible ✅
* Declarative 🤔
* Clear and understandable 😕

=== Key principles
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Improved ease of use for regular software developers
* Sustained flexibility for build engineers and advanced users
* Excellent IDE integration and toolability for everyone

=== Disclaimers
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* We are _experimenting_
* Running those experiments require nightly builds
* Some IDE integrations are demonstrated outside an IDE
* Prototypes are changing all the time and are not ready for real projects

=== Experiments
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

[%step]
* Software types
* Declarative Configuration language with integrated tooling

=== Example

.An Android application
[source,kotlin]
----
// <1>

androidApplication { // <2>
    jdkVersion = 17
    compileSdk = 34
    versionCode = 8
    versionName = "0.1.2"
    applicationId = "org.gradle.experimental.android.application" // <3>
    namespace = "org.gradle.experimental.android.application"
    dependencies { // <4>
        implementation("com.google.guava:guava:32.1.3-jre") // <5>
        implementation(project(":android-util"))
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            dependencies {
                implementation("com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.2.2")
            }
            minifyEnabled = true
        }
    }
}
----
<1> No plugins block
<2> Type of software this build describes
<3> Configuring a simple property
<4> Configuring a block
<5> Type-safe custom dependencies block

[%step]
* First EAP back in July 2024
** see https://blog.gradle.org/declarative-gradle-first-eap[blog post]
* Second EAP in October 2024
** will allow users to experiment with their own builds
** Looking for feedback from developers and build engineers
* Third EAP by the end of the year
** Exact content to be determined
